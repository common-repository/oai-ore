This is a WordPress plugin implementing the 1.0 version of the Open Archives Initiative's Object Reuse and Exchange specification for resource maps, which aggregate any number of related resources.  In this case, the resources are WordPress posts and pages.  In addition, an HTML link header is added for auto-discovery.

The resource map is a profile of the Atom Syndication Format, and it maps to RDF via GRDDL.  For more information, see http://www.openarchives.org/ore/toc/.
